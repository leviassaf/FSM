' This module is created to easily export and import VBA code
' into and from `./src` directory and run basic git commands.
'
' This is needed as Git can't read Excel files directly, but can read the
' source files that are exported.
'
' The export should be ran either on every save or on certain events.
' Note, can't use other modules with importing as they will be deleted and
' won't be able to be accessed.

' @status Development - Exporting seems to be working fine right now,
'                       but still having issues with importing. Looks Like
'                       I can import everything but Sheets, ThisWorkbook, and .frx files.
'                       Maybe create a solution to store just the text of code for sheets
'                       and workbook vs the code export.
